## Key Documentation Corrections

### Before (Incorrect)
- `--update` was documented as only showing update instructions
- No mention of safety checks and protections
- Missing details about installation method detection
- Version badge showed 1.3.0 instead of 1.4.0

### After (Correct)
- `--update` accurately documented as performing actual auto-updates
- Comprehensive safety features documented:
  - Branch protection (main branch only)
  - Uncommitted changes detection
  - Repository validation
  - Fast-forward only merges
  - User confirmation requirements
- Clear distinction between git and standalone update paths
- Version badge correctly shows 1.4.0

## Implementation Highlights Not Previously Documented

1. **Intelligent Installation Detection**
   - Checks for .git directory
   - Validates remote origin points to bradleydwyer/cbox
   - Falls back to installer method for non-git installations

2. **Multiple Safety Layers**
   - Won't update from feature branches (data loss prevention)
   - Won't update with uncommitted changes (work protection)
   - Uses --ff-only flag (prevents merge conflicts)
   - Requires user confirmation (no surprise updates)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Clear error messages for each failure scenario
   - Provides actionable instructions (e.g., "switch to main branch")
   - Graceful fallback to alternative update methods

4. **Post-Update Actions**
   - Offers to rebuild Docker image after git updates
   - Suggests `--verify` command after standalone updates
   - Shows version comparison (old vs new)

## Documentation Quality Improvements

### Added Context
- Explained WHY safety checks exist (prevent data loss, protect development work)
- Documented WHAT happens during updates (step-by-step process)
- Clarified WHEN updates occur (user-initiated with confirmation)
- Specified HOW different installation types are handled

### User Experience Focus
- Clear command examples with comments
- Safety features prominently displayed
- Troubleshooting guidance included
- Confirmation prompts documented

## Verification Steps

All documentation now accurately reflects the implemented functionality:

1. `cbox --update` performs actual updates (not just instructions)
2. Safety checks are properly documented
3. Both git and standalone paths are explained
4. Version numbers are consistent (1.4.0)
5. Help text matches implementation

## Files Modified

1. `/work/README.md` - 3 edits
2. `/work/CLI-REFERENCE.md` - 1 major edit
3. `/work/CHANGELOG.md` - 2 edits
4. `/work/docs/V1.4.0_DOCUMENTATION_REVIEW.md` - Created (comprehensive review)
5. `/work/docs/V1.4.0_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md` - Created (this file)

## Conclusion

The v1.4.0 documentation has been updated to accurately reflect the sophisticated auto-update system that was implemented. The `--update` command is now correctly documented as a fully functional auto-update feature with comprehensive safety checks, not merely an instruction display tool. All safety features and implementation details are now properly documented for user confidence and transparency.
