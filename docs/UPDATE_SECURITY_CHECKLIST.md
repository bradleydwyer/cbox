# Auto-Update Security Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist provides a systematic approach to evaluating auto-update systems for security vulnerabilities. Use this to assess any proposed update mechanism before implementation.

## Critical Security Questions

### 1. Code Integrity and Authenticity

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Are updates cryptographically signed by the vendor?
- [ ] Is signature verification performed before installation?
- [ ] Are signing keys properly protected and rotated?
- [ ] Is there a secure key distribution mechanism?
- [ ] Can the update process detect tampered packages?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ No cryptographic signatures
- ❌ Signature verification is optional
- ❌ Keys are distributed via the same channel as updates
- ❌ No key rotation policy
- ❌ Relies solely on HTTPS for integrity

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Verify update signature before installation
gpg --verify update.sig update.tar.gz
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: Invalid signature"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2. Supply Chain Security

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] What dependencies are included in updates?
- [ ] How are third-party dependencies validated?
- [ ] Is there protection against dependency confusion attacks?
- [ ] Are transitive dependencies audited?
- [ ] Is there a software bill of materials (SBOM)?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ Automatic dependency updates without review
- ❌ No dependency pinning or version locks
- ❌ Allows installation from multiple registries
- ❌ No transitive dependency auditing
- ❌ npm/yarn with write access to node_modules

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Audit dependencies before update
npm audit --audit-level high
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: Vulnerable dependencies"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Persistence and Attack Surface

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Does the update create persistent writable directories?
- [ ] Can malware survive system restarts through the update mechanism?
- [ ] Are update caches and temporary files properly secured?
- [ ] Is there isolation between different projects/users?
- [ ] Can one compromised update affect other applications?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ Persistent writable npm/package directories
- ❌ Shared cache between different security contexts
- ❌ World-writable update directories
- ❌ No cleanup of temporary files
- ❌ Cross-user contamination possible

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Check for dangerous persistent directories
find ~/.cache -type d -perm -002 -exec echo "SECURITY WARNING: World-writable: {}" \;
```

### 4. Network Security

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Are update channels encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)?
- [ ] Is certificate pinning used for update servers?
- [ ] How is the update server authenticated?
- [ ] Are there protections against DNS hijacking?
- [ ] Can updates work through proxies/firewalls?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ HTTP update channels
- ❌ No certificate pinning
- ❌ DNS-only server authentication
- ❌ No proxy support (forces direct connections)
- ❌ Ignores TLS certificate errors

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Verify TLS certificate
openssl s_client -connect api.example.com:443 -servername api.example.com < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | \
openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout | \
grep -i "expected-fingerprint" || {
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: Certificate mismatch"
  exit 1
}
```

### 5. User Control and Consent

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Can users disable automatic updates?
- [ ] Are users prompted before installing updates?
- [ ] Can users review changes before applying them?
- [ ] Is there a rollback mechanism?
- [ ] Can users pin to specific versions?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ Forced automatic updates
- ❌ No user consent required
- ❌ Hidden update mechanisms
- ❌ No rollback capability
- ❌ Cannot disable update checks

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Verify user can control updates
if [[ "${DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE:-0}" != "1" ]] && [[ -z "$USER_CONSENT" ]]; then
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: Forced updates without consent"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 6. Privilege and Permissions

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] What privileges does the update process require?
- [ ] Can updates escalate privileges?
- [ ] Are updates run with minimal necessary permissions?
- [ ] Is there separation between update and runtime privileges?
- [ ] Can unprivileged users trigger privileged updates?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ Requires root/administrator privileges
- ❌ Can modify system-wide files
- ❌ Same privileges for update and runtime
- ❌ No privilege separation
- ❌ Setuid/setgid binaries involved

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Check if running with excessive privileges
if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "SECURITY WARNING: Running as root"
fi

# Verify no setuid files in update
find update_directory -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 | grep . && {
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: Setuid/setgid files in update"
  exit 1
}
```

### 7. Audit and Logging

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Are all update activities logged?
- [ ] Can logs be tampered with by the update process?
- [ ] Are security events clearly identified in logs?
- [ ] Is there alerting for suspicious update activity?
- [ ] Are logs available for forensic analysis?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ No update logging
- ❌ Updates can modify their own logs
- ❌ No security event classification
- ❌ Logs contain sensitive information
- ❌ No tamper detection for logs

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Verify update logging
if [[ ! -f "$UPDATE_LOG" ]]; then
  echo "SECURITY ERROR: No update logging configured"
  exit 1
fi

# Check log permissions
ls -la "$UPDATE_LOG" | grep -E "^-rw-r--r--" || {
  echo "SECURITY WARNING: Incorrect log permissions"
}
```

### 8. Error Handling and Failure Modes

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] How does the system behave when updates fail?
- [ ] Can failed updates leave the system in an insecure state?
- [ ] Are error messages information-leak safe?
- [ ] Is there protection against update loops?
- [ ] Can partial updates be detected and handled?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ Fails insecurely (exposes vulnerabilities)
- ❌ Error messages contain sensitive information
- ❌ No protection against infinite update loops
- ❌ Partial updates leave system in inconsistent state
- ❌ No recovery mechanism for failed updates

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Test failure handling
simulate_update_failure() {
  # Simulate network failure
  timeout 1s update_command || {
    # Verify system is still secure after failure
    verify_system_integrity
  }
}
```

### 9. Compatibility and Regression Testing

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] Are updates tested for security regressions?
- [ ] How are breaking changes communicated?
- [ ] Can users test updates in isolation?
- [ ] Is there automated security testing of updates?
- [ ] Are there compatibility guarantees?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ No regression testing
- ❌ Breaking changes without notice
- ❌ No staging/testing capability
- ❌ Manual testing only
- ❌ No security-specific testing

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Run security tests after update
update_security_test_suite() {
  test_authentication_still_works
  test_authorization_unchanged
  test_input_validation_intact
  test_encryption_still_enabled
}
```

### 10. Incident Response

#### Questions to Ask:
- [ ] How are security issues in updates disclosed?
- [ ] Can malicious updates be quickly revoked?
- [ ] Is there an emergency disable mechanism?
- [ ] How are affected users notified?
- [ ] Is there a security contact for update issues?

#### Red Flags:
- ❌ No security disclosure process
- ❌ Cannot revoke malicious updates
- ❌ No emergency stop mechanism
- ❌ No user notification system
- ❌ No security contact information

#### Example Security Check:
```bash
# Verify emergency disable works
emergency_disable_updates() {
  export EMERGENCY_DISABLE_UPDATES=1
  # Updates should now be blocked
  attempt_update && {
    echo "SECURITY ERROR: Emergency disable failed"
    exit 1
  }
}
```

## Security Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Score | Criteria |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | 9-10 | Remote code execution, credential theft, persistent compromise |
| **HIGH** | 7-8 | Privilege escalation, data exposure, system compromise |
| **MEDIUM** | 4-6 | Information disclosure, DoS, configuration tampering |
| **LOW** | 1-3 | Minor functionality issues, cosmetic problems |

### Assessment Questions

#### For Each Security Control:
1. **Is it implemented?** (Yes/No/Partial)
2. **Is it effective?** (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Can it be bypassed?** (Yes/No/Possibly)
4. **What is the impact if it fails?** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

#### Scoring Formula:
```
Risk Score = (Likelihood × Impact × Exploitability) / Mitigations
```

Where:
- Likelihood: 1-10 (how likely is exploitation)
- Impact: 1-10 (severity of successful attack)
- Exploitability: 1-10 (ease of exploitation)
- Mitigations: 1-10 (effectiveness of controls)

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Trust Without Verification
```bash
# BAD: Trusting update source without verification
curl -s https://updates.example.com/latest.sh | bash

# GOOD: Download, verify, then execute
curl -s https://updates.example.com/latest.sh > update.sh
gpg --verify update.sh.sig update.sh
bash update.sh
```

### 2. Persistent Writable Code Directories
```bash
# BAD: Persistent writable npm directory
mount -o rw ~/.cache/npm:/opt/npm-cache

# GOOD: Read-only mount or tmpfs
mount -o ro ~/.cache/npm:/opt/npm-cache
```

### 3. Automatic Silent Updates
```bash
# BAD: Silent automatic updates
update_if_available() {
  [[ -n "$new_version" ]] && install_update "$new_version"
}

# GOOD: User consent required
update_if_available() {
  if [[ -n "$new_version" ]]; then
    echo "Update available: $new_version"
    read -p "Install? (y/N): " consent
    [[ "$consent" =~ ^[Yy] ]] && install_update "$new_version"
  fi
}
```

### 4. Privileged Update Operations
```bash
# BAD: Running updates as root
sudo ./update.sh

# GOOD: Unprivileged updates
./update.sh  # User-level installation
```

### 5. Mixing Update and Runtime Privileges
```bash
# BAD: Same process handles updates and runtime
main() {
  check_for_updates && apply_updates
  run_application
}

# GOOD: Separate processes and privileges
update_daemon &  # Separate process
run_application  # Different privileges
```

## Conclusion

Auto-update systems introduce significant security complexity. This checklist helps ensure that security is considered at every stage of design and implementation. Remember:

1. **Security First**: Prioritize security over convenience
2. **User Control**: Always give users control over updates
3. **Fail Secure**: Ensure failures don't compromise security
4. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple security layers
5. **Audit Everything**: Log and monitor all update activities

When in doubt, prefer manual updates over automatic ones. The convenience of auto-updates is rarely worth the security risks they introduce.
