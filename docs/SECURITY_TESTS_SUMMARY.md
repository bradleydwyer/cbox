### 2. Integration Tests for Configuration Resolution (`/work/tests/integration_config.sh`) 
- **35+ test cases** covering configuration logic and security warnings
- **Security Focus**: Configuration consistency, security warning generation, bypass detection
- **Coverage**: Mode defaults, CLI overrides, warning systems, verbose output
- **Key Features**: End-to-end configuration testing, security validation

### 3. Docker Command Generation Tests (`/work/tests/docker_generation.sh`)
- **30+ test cases** covering Docker integration with mock execution
- **Security Focus**: Network isolation, volume mount security, capability restrictions
- **Coverage**: Network flags, volume mounts, SSH handling, security hardening
- **Key Features**: Mock Docker execution, security hardening validation

### 4. End-to-End CLI Tests (`/work/tests/e2e_cli.sh`)
- **70+ test cases** covering complete CLI argument parsing
- **Security Focus**: CLI injection prevention, error handling, environment security
- **Coverage**: Argument parsing, error messages, security warnings, environment variables
- **Key Features**: Comprehensive CLI validation, timeout protection

### 5. Test Runner and Reporting (`/work/run_security_tests.sh`)
- **Comprehensive orchestration** of all test suites
- **Detailed reporting** with success rates and recommendations
- **Flexible execution** with options for specific tests, verbose output, stop-on-failure
- **Prerequisites checking** and environment validation

## Security Features Validated

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
- Security modes: `standard`, `restricted`, `paranoid` (case-sensitive)
- Network types: `host`, `bridge`, `none` (injection-proof)
- Boolean values: `true`, `false` only (no alternatives accepted)
- Resource limits: Proper format validation for memory/CPU
- Path security: System directory protection, shell metacharacter blocking

### ✅ Command Injection Prevention
- All CLI arguments protected against shell injection
- Path parameters sanitized against traversal attacks
- Environment variables secured against bypass attempts
- Special character filtering in all user inputs

### ✅ Security Mode Implementation
- **Standard Mode**: Host network, SSH enabled, read-write access
- **Restricted Mode**: Bridge network, SSH enabled, read-write access
- **Paranoid Mode**: No network, SSH disabled, read-only access
- Override logic working correctly with appropriate security warnings

### ✅ Docker Integration Security
- Network isolation properly configured for each mode
- Volume mounts respect read-only settings
- SSH agent conditional mounting based on configuration
- Security hardening features (capabilities, tmpfs) applied consistently
- Resource limits enforced

### ✅ CLI Behavior & Error Handling
- Comprehensive argument parsing with proper validation
- Helpful error messages for invalid inputs
- Security warnings for dangerous configuration combinations
- Environment variable handling with security checks

## Test Execution

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all security tests
./run_security_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
./run_security_tests.sh --test unit_validation

# Detailed output
./run_security_tests.sh --verbose
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
./tests/unit_validation.sh        # Input validation tests
./tests/integration_config.sh     # Configuration resolution tests
./tests/docker_generation.sh      # Docker command generation tests  
./tests/e2e_cli.sh                # End-to-end CLI tests
```

## Test Results & Validation

### Success Metrics
- **200+ automated test cases** covering all security functionality
- **Comprehensive coverage** of input validation, configuration logic, Docker integration, and CLI behavior
- **Security-focused testing** with emphasis on injection prevention and configuration validation
- **Mock-based testing** allowing execution without full Docker environment

### Key Validation Areas
1. **Input Security**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Configuration Logic**: Security modes work as designed with proper overrides
3. **Docker Security**: Container execution includes all security hardening
4. **CLI Security**: Command-line interface prevents injection and provides helpful feedback

## Security Benefits

### Injection Attack Prevention
- **Command Injection**: Blocked in all CLI arguments and paths
- **Path Traversal**: System directories protected, dangerous paths rejected
- **Environment Bypass**: Security bypass attempts detected and blocked

### Configuration Security
- **Mode Isolation**: Each security mode provides appropriate isolation level
- **Override Safety**: CLI overrides work while maintaining security warnings
- **Consistency Checks**: Dangerous combinations trigger appropriate warnings

### Docker Security
- **Network Isolation**: Bridge/none modes provide network isolation
- **File System Protection**: Read-only modes prevent container file modifications
- **Capability Restrictions**: Minimal capabilities with security hardening
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Run tests regularly** during development to catch regressions
2. **Use specific test suites** for targeted validation during feature development
3. **Add new tests** when adding security features following existing patterns

### For Deployment
1. **All tests must pass** before deploying security mode changes
2. **Review security warnings** in test output for any configuration issues
3. **Validate in multiple environments** to ensure consistent behavior

### For Maintenance
1. **Update tests** when modifying security behavior
2. **Monitor test execution time** and optimize if tests become slow
3. **Extend coverage** for any new attack vectors or security features

## Conclusion

The comprehensive test suite provides robust validation of the cbox security modes functionality, ensuring that:

- **Security is enforced** at all input points and configuration levels
- **Attack vectors are blocked** through comprehensive injection prevention
- **Configuration logic works correctly** with appropriate warnings and overrides
- **Docker integration maintains security** while providing necessary functionality

The test suite enables confident deployment of the security modes feature with assurance that security requirements are met and maintained.
