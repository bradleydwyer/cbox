- Fixed placeholder URLs in help text
- Removed outdated reference to COMMIT_MESSAGE.md
- Corrected Hermit configuration syntax errors

### Removed
- Telemetry documentation (feature never implemented)

### Fixed
- SSH agent socket permission issues
- Directory path handling with spaces
- Container cleanup on exit
- Memory and CPU resource constraints

### Security
