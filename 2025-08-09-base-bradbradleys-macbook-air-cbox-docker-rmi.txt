 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

  Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them
  --dangerously-skip-permissions cannot be used with root/sudo privileges for security reasons
  (base) brad@Bradleys-MacBook-Air cbox %

⏺ I see the issue. When running Claude Code inside a Docker container as root (which is the default), the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag cannot be used for security reasons. Let me fix this
   by modifying the Dockerfile to run as a non-root user.

⏺ Read(Dockerfile)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Read(cbox)
  ⎿  Read 90 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see the script has already been updated to handle user permissions properly with gosu. The issue is that the cached Dockerfile is outdated. Let me delete the cached Dockerfile to force a
   rebuild with the new user handling:

⏺ Bash(rm -f "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/cbox/Dockerfile")
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now rebuild and run:

⏺ Bash(CBOX_REBUILD=1 ./cbox)
  ⎿  Error: #1 [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
     #1 sha256:e68cc9763b4be9fcf86fdb56b3d7bb65a1986a6dfa540fc9a7d6c9649900c2de
     #1 transferring dockerfile: 1.04kB done
     #1 DONE 0.0s

     #2 [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/node:20-bookworm-slim
     #2 sha256:14692134158e996411cc18c657fe177bc1f5777f933e8fc06f9b3f2b907903da
     #2 DONE 0.8s

     #3 [internal] load .dockerignore
     … +65 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

⏺ The Docker container built successfully but there's a TTY issue when running it. Let me check if we're in an interactive terminal:

⏺ Bash(tty)
  ⎿  Error: not a tty

⏺ The issue is that we're not in an interactive terminal. The cbox script uses docker run -it which requires a TTY. Let me modify the script to detect this and handle it appropriately:

⏺ Update(cbox)
  ⎿  Updated cbox with 7 additions and 1 removal  
       78      CLAUDE_ARGS+=("$@")
       79    fi
       80    
       81 -  exec docker run --rm -it \
       81 +  # Detect if we have a TTY
       82 +  TTY_FLAGS=""
       83 +  if [ -t 0 ] && [ -t 1 ]; then
       84 +    TTY_FLAGS="-it"
       85 +  fi
       86 +  
       87 +  exec docker run --rm $TTY_FLAGS \
       88      -e HOME=/home/host \
       89      -e USER=host \
       90      -e TERM="${TERM:-xterm-256color}" \

⏺ Now the script detects whether it's running in an interactive terminal and only adds the -it flags when appropriate. The image has been rebuilt to run as a non-root user using gosu, which
  allows the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag to work correctly.
