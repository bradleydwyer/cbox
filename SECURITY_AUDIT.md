# Security Audit Report - cbox Installation

## Executive Summary
Implementation of secure installation process with checksum verification to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and ensure file integrity.

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Checksum Verification System (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**OWASP Reference:** A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

#### Implementation Details:
- **SHA256SUMS File**: Contains SHA256 checksums for all downloadable scripts
- **Verification Function**: `verify_checksum()` validates file integrity before installation
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Installation aborts if checksum verification fails
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with both `sha256sum` (Linux) and `shasum` (macOS)

#### Security Controls:
```bash
# Files protected by checksums:
- cbox (main script)
- cbox-update (update script)
- SHA256SUMS (checksum file itself)
```

### 2. Download Security (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Implementation Details:
- **HTTPS-Only Downloads**: All files downloaded via HTTPS from GitHub
- **Atomic Downloads**: All files downloaded to temporary directory first
- **Verification Before Installation**: Checksums verified before moving to system directories
- **Cleanup on Failure**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files on error

### 3. Installation Integrity (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Additional Security Script:
- **verify-install.sh**: Validates install.sh integrity before execution
- **Known-Good Checksum**: Hardcoded checksum for install.sh verification
- **Clear Security Warnings**: Explicit warnings if tampering detected

### 4. Fixed Security Issues

#### URL Placeholder Fix
- **Before**: `https://github.com/yourusername/cbox`
- **After**: `https://github.com/bradleydwyer/cbox`
- **Impact**: Prevents potential typosquatting attacks

## Security Test Cases

### Test 1: Valid Installation
```bash
# Verify install.sh integrity
./verify-install.sh

# Run installation
bash install.sh
```
**Expected**: Successful installation with checksum verification

### Test 2: Tampered File Detection
```bash
# Simulate tampered cbox file
echo "malicious code" > /tmp/cbox
# Checksum verification should fail
```
**Expected**: Installation aborts with security error

### Test 3: Missing Checksum File
```bash
# Remove SHA256SUMS from server
# Attempt installation
```
**Expected**: Installation aborts for security reasons

### Test 4: Network MITM Protection
```bash
# If checksums don't match downloaded files
```
**Expected**: Installation fails with checksum mismatch error

## Security Headers Configuration

### Recommended Headers for GitHub Repository
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'
```

## Defense in Depth Layers

1. **Layer 1**: HTTPS transport encryption
2. **Layer 2**: SHA256 checksum verification
3. **Layer 3**: Atomic installation with rollback
4. **Layer 4**: Privilege separation (non-root installation)
5. **Layer 5**: Temporary file cleanup on failure

## Severity Assessment

| Finding | Severity | Status | CVSS |
|---------|----------|--------|------|
| Missing checksum verification | HIGH | ✅ Fixed | 7.5 |
| Placeholder GitHub URL | MEDIUM | ✅ Fixed | 5.3 |
| No integrity check for install.sh | MEDIUM | ✅ Fixed | 6.1 |
| Downloads without verification | HIGH | ✅ Fixed | 8.1 |

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] **OWASP A08:2021** - Software and Data Integrity Failures
- [x] **CWE-494** - Download of Code Without Integrity Check
- [x] **CWE-345** - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
- [x] **NIST 800-53 SI-7** - Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity

## Recommendations for Maintainers

1. **Update Checksums**: When updating scripts, regenerate SHA256SUMS:
   ```bash
   sha256sum cbox cbox-update > SHA256SUMS
   ```

2. **Update Verification Script**: After modifying install.sh:
   ```bash
   sha256sum install.sh
   # Update checksum in verify-install.sh
   ```

3. **Sign Releases** (Future Enhancement):
   - Consider GPG signing for releases
   - Implement signature verification in installer

4. **Version Pinning** (Future Enhancement):
   - Pin specific versions of dependencies
   - Implement version verification
